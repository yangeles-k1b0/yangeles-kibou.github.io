                        Pedophilia is a simple issue blown out of proportion. Dislike for it stems from misinformation-a lack of
                        understanding with regard to what it is. People with pedophilic tendencies or minor attracted persons (also
                        known as MAPs) are the real victims. Thus, they are in dire need of our sympathy and kindness. They have
                        been sitting in the shadows for far too long, bound by the shackles of oppression. It is time that they be
                        acknowledged as upstanding members of our society.
                    </div>
                    <div class="bodytext">
                        Children have been greatly miseducated and wrongly shielded from the truth. Innocent children of youthful
                        age have impressionable minds. The regressive and judgemental thinking that “grown-ups” force upon
                        them obstructs their perspective. Pedophilia is not wrong; in fact, it is a sexual orientation- as natural as
                        being born a homosexual! Society’s prejudice against MAPs can be, with but little effort, addressed by
                        teaching our young that pedophilia is a sexual identity and not a moral deviation. Additionally, Sex
                        Education should be implemented in their curriculum starting from pre-school. Let us not belittle the young
                        ones; they are perfectly capable of making decisions. If they can understand their ABC’s, they can certainly
                        comprehend the workings of the human body.
                    </div>
                    <div class="bodytext">
                        There should be implemented a small tweak in our laws as well. The age of consent should be lowered a
                        tad, around the age five or six, to allow MAPs to enter in certain relationships with children, but still keeping
                        zero to four-year-olds safe from any physical harm. After all, we should be realistic: babies and toddlers
                        aren’t capable of being intimate with adults, regardless of how irresistible they are for some. Following this
                        law, countries should also exempt and no longer list pedophiles in the sex offender registry. Rest assured-
                        MAPs are absolutely innocent of the heinous crimes society attributes to them, meaning the need to track
                        them is unnecessary. It is likewise unlawful, as they are private citizens.
                    </div>
                    <div class="bodytext">
                        An anti-discrimination law should be created in favor of MAPs, and propaganda against them, limited. They
                        have the right to voice out their beliefs, no matter how controversial these may seem. Remember, freedom
                        of expression is an integral part of society. Other persons who hold unpopular views on race, sexuality, and
                        religion may often be criticized, but they are at least allowed to express themselves. Why shouldn’t MAPs
                        enjoy the same liberties?
                    </div>
                    <div class="bodytext">
                        MAPs are an oppressed minority, much like African-Americans, Native Americans, and the aborigines of
                        Australia. But unlike these groups, they have yet to be recognized as such by society. If their brothers and
                        sisters in the LGBTQ+ community have already found support, why shouldn’t they? If society is defending
                        the rights of black and homosexual people, why should MAPs be thrown into the sewers? After all, boys
                        loving boys and girls loving girls are equivalent to full-grown adults loving babies.
                    </div>
                    <div class="bodytext">
                        More movements can be initiated to further embrace MAPs. People have been “protecting” their children by
                        keeping them away from pedophiles, but the opposite must be done. They should be able to hold jobs in
                        which they can interact with the young ones. Better yet, recruit them for these positions. What better way to
                        protect children than to allow them to be with the people who love them most?
                    </div>
                    <div class="bodytext">
                        Speaking of bringing together MAPs and the objects of their affection, online platforms should be set up for
                        ease both in communication and the establishment of connections. Forums wherein they can interact with
                        fellow MAPs and children would be created. These will act as safe spaces to console and make them feel
                        accepted. There should also be dating apps where they can meet and chat with minors. This way, they can
                        be with people whom they truly love. They should also be allowed and encouraged to join the pride march,
                        so they can show how proud they are of themselves.
                    </div>

                        My only intention for writing this proposal is for the benefit of the oppressed and of society. Not a single
                        solution to pedophilia has been proven to work. Modern solutions for preventing child abuse have not been
                        effective, so why not let nature take its course instead?
